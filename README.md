# Erofs Rust Userspace Library

This Repository rewrites the original Extended Read-only FileSystem Userspace Library and Tools using Rust.

It comes with total rewrite of implementation logic with the causion of just a little unsafe code to make sure its compatibility.

Much or the `erofs-sys` will be embedded on the Linux kernel Side library.
